# RTaxometricsPlus
This is a fork of Wang &amp; Ruscio's RTaxometric package. The goal of this fork is to have faster analysis and better plots. Usage improvements will also be implemented wherever it's possible. 

## How is it different from the original RTaxometrics?

* DisplayProfile() uses ggplot2 instead of default R plot libraries, which results in prettier plots
* DisplayProfile has an option to return ggplot2 object if ran separately
* There is a ggplot2 dependency, obviously
